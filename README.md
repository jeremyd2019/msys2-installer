## FAQ

### What's the difference between the installer and the archives?

The installer provides some additional features such as installing shortcuts, registering an uninstaller, a GUI for selecting the installation path and automatically running a login shell at the end to initialize the MSYS2 environment.

If you unpack the archives and run a login shell once, you will get a functionally equivalent MSYS2 installation.

### What is contained in the installer/archives?

It contains the [base](https://packages.msys2.org/package/base) package and all its dependencies. You can list the contained packages using: `pactree base -lu | sort`
